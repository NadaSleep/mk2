## Mortal Kombat 2 Website

This is a mock Mortal Kombat 2 website that is being used for my portfolio as well as my Code Louisville capstone project. To view the site please open the home.html file on your browser of choice.

## This website contains

.Media queries that rearrange from a one column layout to a two column layout

.Image carousel with 3 images-Located on the about page

.JavaScript that changes the information displayed for the character grid-Located on the Characters page

## Special sections

Inspired by the character selection of MK2 the characters page allows you to select a character and see their info to the right of your screen or the top depending on your device or screen size.

The About page contains an image carousel which shows you behind the scene images from Mortal Kombat. Click the dragon logos on the left and right side to cycle through the images.

I will continue to update and add new features to this site, please check back!
